This script adds a "Download Chapters" button next to the already existing buttons (such as "Follow" or "Donate") to all fictions and "Download Chapter" buttons to every chapter on the [Royal Road website](https://www.royalroad.com).

When the button is pressed, the script scrapes the chosen chapters of the fiction into easily readable .html files, and packages them into a .zip file.

The .html files contain styling to emulate Royal Road's default dark mode (with font size 16 due to personal preference), and working previous/next chapter buttons on desktop using the [file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme).
