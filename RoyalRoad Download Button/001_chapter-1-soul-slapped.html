              >At the heart of the world of Niyl stood a mountain of impossible
              height. Its sheer cliffs of permafrost were vertical walls gnawed
              by unceasing winds, and in it hid horrid creatures. From grumpy
              wyrms to ancient elementals, its fauna was the deadliest in the
              world, while outside, scathing magical gales could scour the flesh
              from the bones of even the hardiest explorers. And yet, every
              year, some still tried to climb to its peak, for it harbored the
              city of the gods: Larrean.</span

              >Ah, Larrean, where strolls could last for moments or eons, where
              demiurges beat the pavement hand in hand with beings as old as
              time itself. Solemn temples of marble and gold rose next to
              eldritch constructs of shells and bones. Coral walls encircled
              crystal towers and obsidian keeps. The air smelled of spring, of
              brine, of a kiss by the sea, changing with every step. It was an
              impossible land where only the mightiest could tread and where one
              could sell a soul to buy a moment.</span

              monarch of this flourishing metropolis and it guarded its spot

              the world.</span

              their vigil on either side of a stained glass window of epic
              proportions. The masterwork represented a decade of grueling
              effort from a legendary artist, each dye, each detail
              painstakingly placed to render the victory of the current pantheon
              over the primordial gods.</span
